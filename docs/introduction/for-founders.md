## Problem: Distribution is hard

The fair distribution of cryptographic assets has proven to be a hard problem: today, cryptocurrencies and tokens are distributed to users through a variety of methods, including public and private sales. While these methods are efficient, for many projects, it is hard to maintain a balance between fairness and transparency and, at the same time, ensure that the tokenomics are sustainable and aligned with the interests of all stakeholders. This can lead to a number of issues, including:

- **Rug pulls**: where the project team or insiders sell their tokens and leave the project, leaving investors with worthless assets.
- **Liquidity issues**: where the project team or insiders control the liquidity of the token, leading to price manipulation and lack of trust from investors.

## Solution: Automated tokenomics 

The Oikos protocol is designed to overcome the issues of traditional distribution methods by providing a novel way to 
launch tokens that seed their own liquidity. For each Oikos token, the protocol acts as a market making middleware for the liquidity it controls, while the algorithmic structure of the liquidity guarantees the protocol can buy back the whole circulating supply at any time. In addition, the protocol revenue stream is fed back into the liquidity, which allows the protocol to increase the floor price of tokens over time. The liquidity is entirely programmable, which means it can be adjusted to meet the needs of the project in terms of market structure and reactivity to market conditions.
