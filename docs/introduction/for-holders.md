## Problem: Broken expectations

In today's world, the cryptocurrency industry has become a cut-throat environment, where the majority of projects are designed to extract value from users rather than provide them with real utility. This has led to a lack of trust and confidence in the industry, as users are often left feeling exploited and disillusioned. The traditional model of token distribution has also contributed to this problem, as it often leads to a concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few insiders, while leaving the majority of users with little or no stake in the project.

## Solution: A change of paradigm

The Oikos protocol provides a novel way for projects to launch tokens with transparency and fairness baked into the protocol at code level. With this innovative model, the circulating outside the protocol's control must be backed 1:1 by real liquidity, at the floor price. This means that the protocol can buy back the whole circulating supply at any time, while guaranteeing the price will ever reach a determined level. In addition, the liquidity is controlled by the protocol itself, rather than by insiders or the project team. This creates a sustainable and aligned economy that benefits all stakeholders, rather than just a select few.
