The Oikos Launchpad enables anyone to launch their own token with guaranteed floor price mechanics, dynamic liquidity, and built-in utilities that create sustainable markets.

## A New Generation of Token Launches

Traditional token launch methods often lead to problematic market dynamics:
- Excessive selling pressure from early investors
- Reliance on profit-motivated external market makers
- Vulnerability to market manipulation
- Unpredictable liquidity crises

Oikos addresses these challenges by creating tokens with:
- Guaranteed minimum value backed by protocol reserves
- Protocol-owned and managed liquidity
- Self-sustaining market making operations
- Transparent price discovery mechanisms

## Launchpad Process

Launching a token with Oikos follows a straightforward process:

### 1. Initial Guaranteed Minimum Value (IGMV) Event

- Configurable event where initial capital is raised
- Establishes the starting floor price for your token
- Options for allowlists, capital limits, and tiered pricing
- All funds directed to the protocol's liquidity reserves

### 2. Liquidity Configuration

- Set parameters for liquidity distribution across price ranges
- Configure desired trading characteristics 
- Determine initial price discovery range
- Tailor market behavior to your project's needs

### 3. Token Distribution

- Full supply is minted at launch with no hidden vesting
- Distribute tokens to team, community, and investors
- Create transparent tokenomics with no future supply shocks
- Lock portions for team members if desired

### 4. Market Activation

- Liquidity is automatically deployed across three ranges
- Trading begins with protocol-managed market making
- All trading fees reinvested to strengthen the floor price
- Continuous price discovery with no external intervention
